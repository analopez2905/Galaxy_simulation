# Galaxy_simulation_SPH

The implementation of a galaxy simulator is presented, utilizing the C programming language and the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique for an N-body simulation. The parameters of smoothing length and the control of adaptive time precision were varied to optimize the balance between results and costs. Additionally, a modular programming approach was implemented for this galaxy simulator.

This project was conducted for the Computational Astrophysics course.
